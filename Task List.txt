1-Integration of the two datasets
2-Merging of features that can be merged
3-Handle Missing Data
4-Then perform preprocessing on that merged dataset
5-Feature selection that what features needs to be fed into algo
6-First we should try logistic regression
7-That requires numeric features so convert categorical features into numeric features
8-And also normalization needs to be done
9-Then run logistic regression algo
10-Need to evaluate accuracy precision recall fmeasure and roc curve
11- if required accuracy achieved then proceed to next step otherwise repeat the process with some parameter changes in the same alogo or on different algo (Say Random Forrest)
12- Then web form and web api needs to be built
